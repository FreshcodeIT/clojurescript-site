Current status:

* ClojureScript can now compile both its analyzer & compiler w/o errors.
Can eval non-trivial ClojureScript exprs from within the JS host.
* Performance reading, analysis & compilation within bootstrapped
ClojureScript has been optimized to be roughly within a factor of 2 of
ClojureScript JVM (varying perf between engines).

* Master is successfully being used in various contexts:

The following enumerates the remaining tasks:

* Ensure perf is good.
* Ensure defects are addressed. Many have `bootstrap` label:

Query]
* Determine if shared bootstrap REPL code will be included and
implement.

_* you can use the

API reference] to help identify imported macros and related Clojure

As a point of reference, https://github.com/kanaka/clojurescript is a
previous project to bootstrap the ClojureScript compiler. It is fairly
dated since it was forked from the main tree on Nov 16th, 2012, however,
it was self-hosting and allowed for a fully browser-based REPL (original
version of http://clojurescript.net/). A presentation of the project
from Clojure West 2013 is here:
